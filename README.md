# Hand-Drawn Comics Gallery

A simple react app that shows a gallery of comic book covers, and uses Lightbox to focus on each.

Each photo has 3 available resolutions. The logic is pretty straight-forward.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
